# nix-config
Nix configuration.

Notes:
- Using home-manager.
- Only attempting to run on darwin for now.
- Not using `nix-darwin` for now.
- Slightly preference for bringing along old dotfiles vs. moving config into the nix language.

TODO:
- Move .zsh/pure config into here
- zsh configuration
- VSCode
