# nix-config
Nix home-manager configuration.

Notes:
- Using home-manager.
- Only attempting to run on darwin for now.
- Not using `nix-darwin` for now.
- Slight preference for bringing along old dotfiles vs. moving config into the nix language.
- Don't try to manage frequently edited config files with nix.

TODO:
- VSCode
- Linking graphical applications into /Applications? https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/issues/1341
